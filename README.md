odin project: etch-a-sketch





* **Make a square grid 16x16** **✅**
* **Make mouseover function working✅**
* **Add randomColor function working ✅**
* **Limit to 100x100 is set for inputUser ✅**
* **Button is at the top of the page ✅**



* **Encountered one issue where squares didnt fit into the grid (container), they went "over" the grid at the Bottom :**

&nbsp;	- this was due to border set in style.css for .container and .square

&nbsp;	- removing those borders fixed issue

&nbsp;	- i used primarly to help me see if the square were correctly placed (with flexbox and the createGrid function in JS)

&nbsp;	- kinda looks better without them anyway ?
